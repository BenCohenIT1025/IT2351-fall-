# *Executive Summary*
In this section I we will be doing “insert, Update, Copy, and Delete” commands 
## Query Descriptions 
1. With the first insert query I had to insert a record into the customers table, I am almost positive I did it wrong. This is the one I was struggling with the most. 
2. The second query was Updating the products table by increasing the unit price by %5 for anything with a unit stock under 50. I believe I did this one correct.  
3. The third query was to copy a customers table that only those customers in France. I know I did this one correct (hopefully) then the fourth was use that same table but delete the customers from Lillie in which I did. 

## Conclusion

I am struggling with all aspects of this course, so each of these where challenging.
