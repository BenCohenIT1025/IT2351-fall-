**For the first part of the assignment I think I got really close I just could not get the date to convert the value. I tried changing the values anyway I could think of. I know you said create a function to convert so I tried that. I just could not figure out how to add the function. When I tried to add the function code into the trigger code it wouldn’t work so I tried to create a function then have it call with the trigger function but that wouldn’t work so this is as close as I could get.**

My event I created is simply updating the customer contact info starting now and then every hour. I did not turn on the events because I didn’t know what it would do to the data base and I wouldn’t know how to turn it off or fix something if I messed it up.

**The rationale behind creating an event would be if you want something to run on a set basis. Such as updating accounting logs or customer contact names. They are an easy way to have something happen without the programmer needing to be there to create the action every time. The logic for the event has minimum requirements. They keyword “create event” and the name of the event. The “on schedule” which determines the schedule of the event and the “DO” which contains the SQL statement to be executed by the event.**
