This lab I thought was extremely hard. I tried my best to get as close to what you wanted as I could. I was able to write all of it without errors in the script but most of it wouldn’t return what it was supposed to.
For number 5 I tried to just call the view and add a sum and group by statement but it wouldn’t work so I ended up just modifying my view script by adding a sum(quantity) and a group by statement.
