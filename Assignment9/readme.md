I had no idea what to do on this one. I tried my best. I didn’t want to keep bothering you because I didn’t know what to ask or where to start. The best I could do was find an example and try to build off of it to do what I wanted it to do. But, it still didn’t. Wouldn’t it just be easier to use a sum statement with a where.
