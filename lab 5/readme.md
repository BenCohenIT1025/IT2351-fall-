This one wasn’t so bad. I really do not see much of a difference between CAST and CONVERT. To me they are almost interchangeable. I believe I did everything the assignment asked for. I did save the script to the workbench as a SaveAs file and it changed the tabs name as you can see in the uploaded assignment.

The CAST statement was similar to the first assignment, so it wasn’t to hard. The book and w3 school had the layout of the order. I believe I did what you wanted by returning the full date and time. The second part was not bad either. All I did was put the amount of CHAR I wanted to return and it only brought back the year and month.
