### The Assighnment2No1Script is a query that shows the customers name or contact the shipped date and freight. I ordered the query by ASC order of the customers name. 

### The Assighnment2No2script was a pain, I needed to have product name, unit price and quantity. But unit price kept giving me a error code 1052 so i had to make aliases for the tables. 

### The Assighnment2No3script was not as bad as 2 because I was able to give the tables aliases right away and so the product name, category name and supplier name went in order. 

###  query to show customer name, product name, ship date and quantity for all of the customer orders.  Format the ship date
