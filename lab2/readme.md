### The Assighnment2No1Script is a query that shows the customers name or contact the shipped date and freight. I ordered the query by ASC order of the customers name. 

### The Assighnment2No2script was a pain, I needed to have product name, unit price and quantity. But unit price kept giving me a error code 1052 so i had to make aliases for the tables.
