## Assignment 1

This one was a little bit easier compared to the other. The only part I had trouble with was ROUND to two decimal places and the placement of the 2. After searching the book, I found it on page 177. 

## Assignment 2

This assignment was a bit more difficult; I could not get the cat name to bring in anything other then Beverages. I was able to get the rest of it to work. 

## Assignment 3

This assignment was a bit more difficult then the first, I did not know what you wanted me to use the IF as so I left it out.
