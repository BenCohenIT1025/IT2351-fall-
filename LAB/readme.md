## Lab part 3
I could not get it to work the way i wanted it to. I did email you sunday but it was getting late so I just did my best and submitted it.
I started running into problems when I created a table, some of the columns would only repeat a number or name or not fill anything in. Then I could not get the round to work even though it didnâ€™t need rounding. I was able to get some of it working. 

## Lab Part 4
For this one I just did an inner join with the SupplierID link. I had to select all the rows from table 2 but only the Product name from table 1
I tried to do a left join and a right join but the inner join worked best for what i wanted it to do. I am not sure how to just drop a column from on table 
into another table without selecting all of the rows from the second table. 
## Lab Part 5, Conclusion on the data. 
The data shows that there are 4 companies that are out of stock with no reorder values and 1 with no reorder value but not out of stock yet. so they will not reorder until manually ordered. Also Specialty Biscuts has a reorder lvl higher than units on order. That means when they order it will automatically order again to fill the min value.
